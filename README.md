# ICMR-NIE-INTERNSHIP-SUBMISSION-PORTAL-USING-PHP-MYSQL-
The ICMR-NIE Internship Submission Portal Using PHP and MySQL is a web application developed to simplify and digitize the internship application process for the Indian Council of Medical Research - National Institute of Epidemiology (ICMR-NIE). This platform allows applicants to submit their personal details, educational background, and upload essential documents such as CVs and bonafide certificates through an easy-to-use online form.The system is built using PHP for server-side scripting and MySQL for secure and efficient data management. The user interface employs HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a responsive design with real-time validation, reducing input errors. File uploads are handled securely with unique file naming and organized storage. The application integrates PHPMailer to automatically send confirmation emails to applicants, improving communication.Additionally, the portal enforces eligibility criteria like age restrictions and internship duration to ensure adherence to ICMR-NIE guidelines. Developed and tested on a local XAMPP server, this project offers a scalable and robust solution for managing internship submissions.
